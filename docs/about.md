# The tools included are as follows:
- [Malwarebytes AdwCleaner](https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner)
- [ESET Online Scanner](https://www.eset.com/int/home/online-scanner/)
- [HitmanPro](https://www.hitmanpro.com/en-us/downloads)
- [TrendMicro Housecall](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ca/forHome/products/housecall.html)
- [Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool](https://www.kaspersky.com/downloads/free-virus-removal-tool)
- [Malwarebytes Free](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) (14-day premium trial included if you're a first-time user.)

I have compiled these tools in a .zip file which you can download [here.](/download.md)

Alternatively, **if you don't trust me**, you can access the links above and download them one-by-one instead.

All of these programs except Malwarebytes Free are portable, which means you do not need to install them.

Keep in mind that you need Administrator privileges to run these tools.

"The Second Opinion" is coined from "The PC Security Channel" in YouTube. Find his stuff [here.](https://www.youtube.com/@pcsecuritychannel)

This project is created so I have a personal link for my tools, in case I lose my thumb drive that contains them.

## Like this project?
If you like this project, you can help me by sharing it with your friends who are in need of such tools. I started helping my friends with tech-related problems when I saw the need for it. I didn't have anyone helping me, so I tried learning it on my own. I don't claim to be a tech-wiz or a know-it-all, but I'm sharing what I know, to help others.
